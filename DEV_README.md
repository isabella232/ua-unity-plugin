# Building the plugin

To build the plugin from source, do the following:

1. Install doxygen, Android SDK, Xcode, and Unity
2. Build the plugin with `./gradlew build`

Docs will be available in `docs/build/html` and a unitypackage will be created in `build/`. If an error occurs, the unity.log
file is available in the build directory.
